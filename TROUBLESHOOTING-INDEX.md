# Troubleshooting Guide Index

Quick links to troubleshooting guides for common issues with the Azure Initial Setup and Azure Bootstrap & Deploy workflows.

## 🚨 Common Issues

### GitHub App / Authentication Issues

#### ❌ "Not Found - GitHub App Token Generation Failed (404)"
**Error**: `Failed to create token for "XYDataLabs.OrderProcessingSystem" (attempt 1-4): Not Found`

**Cause**: GitHub App is not installed on this repository

**Solution**: [TROUBLESHOOTING-GITHUB-APP-404.md](./TROUBLESHOOTING-GITHUB-APP-404.md)

**Quick Fix**:
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/installations
2. Configure your GitHub App
3. Add `XYDataLabs.OrderProcessingSystem` to repository access
4. Re-run workflow

---

#### ❌ "APP_ID and APP_PRIVATE_KEY Showing as Missing"
**Error**: 
```
APP_ID                : ❌ Missing
APP_PRIVATE_KEY       : ❌ Missing
```

**Cause**: Workflow not running in environment context, looking for repository secrets instead of environment secrets

**Solution**: [TROUBLESHOOTING-APP-SECRETS-MISSING.md](./TROUBLESHOOTING-APP-SECRETS-MISSING.md)

**Quick Fix**:
1. Run workflow with specific environment selected (dev/staging/prod)
2. Don't select "all" if using environment secrets
3. Ensure workflow has latest changes with environment context

---

#### ℹ️ "What is APP_INSTALLATION_ID?"
**Question**: Do I need to configure APP_INSTALLATION_ID as a secret?

**Answer**: **No!** Installation ID is automatically discovered at runtime.

**Details**: [APP_INSTALLATION_ID_EXPLAINED.md](./APP_INSTALLATION_ID_EXPLAINED.md)

---

### Workflow Update Issues

#### ⚠️ "Workflow Update Requires Manual Action"
**Error**: `refusing to allow a GitHub App to create or update workflow without 'workflows' permission`

**Cause**: GITHUB_TOKEN lacks permission to modify workflow files (security feature)

**Solution**: Manual one-time edit required

**Quick Fix**:
1. Edit `.github/workflows/infra-deploy.yml`
2. Change `if: false  # TODO: Enable after bootstrap` to `if: (github.event_name == 'push') || ...`
3. Commit and push

**Alternative**: Grant your GitHub App "Workflows: Read and write" permission (advanced)

---

### Azure OIDC Issues

#### ❌ "Azure Login Failed"
**Error**: Azure CLI login timeout or authentication failure

**Cause**: Device code not entered within timeout window

**Quick Fix**:
1. Re-run workflow with "Setup Azure OIDC" enabled
2. Complete device code authentication within 3 minutes
3. Ensure you have proper Azure permissions

---

#### ❌ "AADSTS700213: No matching federated identity record"
**Error**: `AADSTS700213: No matching federated identity record found for presented assertion subject 'repo:...:environment:staging'`

**Cause**: The Azure AD App Registration is missing the federated identity credential for the target environment. This happens when Phase 1a was never run, or was run for a single environment instead of `all`.

**Diagnosis**: Bootstrap jobs now include a **Diagnose Azure Login Failure** step that detects this automatically and prints remediation steps in the workflow summary.

**Quick Fix**:
1. Go to **Actions → Azure Initial Setup → Run workflow**
2. Set **Use workflow from** = `dev` branch
3. Defaults are correct (environment=`all`, Phase 1a + 1b enabled) — click **Run workflow**
4. Wait for completion
5. Re-run the original **Azure Bootstrap & Deploy** workflow

---

#### ❌ "OIDC App Not Found"
**Error**: `Failed to create or find OIDC app 'GitHub-Actions-OIDC'`

**Cause**: OIDC setup script failed or insufficient Azure AD permissions

**Quick Fix**:
1. Verify you have Application Administrator role in Azure AD
2. Check Azure CLI is authenticated: `az account show`
3. Re-run workflow with "Setup Azure OIDC" enabled
4. Review OIDC setup logs

---

### Branch / Environment Mismatch

#### ❌ "Branch/environment mismatch"
**Error**: `ERROR: Branch 'staging' does not match expected branch for environment 'dev'`

**Cause**: The workflow requires the branch to match the environment (`dev`→dev, `staging`→staging, `main`→prod).

**Exception**: The **Azure Initial Setup** workflow (Phase 0/1a/1b) does not enforce branch/environment matching — it can be run from any branch. A recommendation message is shown if `environment` is not set to `all`.

**Quick Fix**:
- For **Azure Bootstrap & Deploy** (Phase 2/X/deploy): Use the correct branch (`dev` for dev, `staging` for staging, `main` for prod)
- For **Azure Initial Setup** (Phase 0/1a/1b): Use `branch=dev`, `environment=all` (recommended one-time setup)

## 📖 Understanding the Workflow

### ❓ FAQ: What Is the GitHub App For? (Why APP_ID + APP_PRIVATE_KEY?)

**Question**: We store `APP_ID` and `APP_PRIVATE_KEY` in GitHub secrets. The GitHub App is also in GitHub. So what does the GitHub App actually DO?

**Answer**: The GitHub App is a **privileged GitHub API client** used to write secrets from inside a workflow.

| Credential | Can write GitHub secrets? | Can authenticate to Azure? |
|------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` (built-in) | ❌ No — security restriction | ❌ No |
| **GitHub App installation token** | ✅ **Yes — `Secrets: write`** | ❌ No |
| Azure OIDC (`AZUREAPPSERVICE_*`) | ❌ No | ✅ **Yes — `azure/login@v2`** |

`GITHUB_TOKEN` (the automatic token every workflow run gets) does **not** have permission to write repository secrets. The GitHub App installation token — generated at runtime from `APP_ID` + `APP_PRIVATE_KEY` using `actions/create-github-app-token@v1` — **does** have `Secrets: write` permission.

So: `APP_ID` + `APP_PRIVATE_KEY` are stored so the workflow can generate a short-lived token to call `gh secret set AZUREAPPSERVICE_*`. That is their only purpose.

### ❓ FAQ: Why Do Phases 1b, 2, and 3 Depend on Azure OIDC?

**Question**: Why does Azure OIDC appear as a dependency in Phase 1b, 2, and 3? Can Phase 0 + 1a alone be used as prerequisites?

**Answer**: The dependency is different for each phase. Phase 1b's "dependency" is NOT the same as Phase 2 and 3.

| Phase | Azure OIDC dependency | What actually happens |
|-------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Phase 1b** | Needs credential **values** only | Stores clientId/tenantId/subscriptionId as `AZUREAPPSERVICE_*` GitHub secrets. Does NOT authenticate to Azure. |
| **Phase 2** | Needs credentials to **authenticate** | Uses `azure/login@v2` with `AZUREAPPSERVICE_*` to log in to Azure and provision infrastructure. |
| **Phase X (cleanup)** | Needs credentials to **authenticate** | Uses `azure/login@v2` with `AZUREAPPSERVICE_*` to log in to Azure and delete resources. |
| **Deploy (API/UI)** | Needs credentials to **authenticate** | Uses `azure/login@v2` with `AZUREAPPSERVICE_*` to log in to Azure and deploy applications. |

**Phase 0 alone is NOT sufficient for Phase 1b, 2, or X:**
- Phase 0 only creates the GitHub App (for writing GitHub secrets).
- Phase 1a creates the Azure identity and produces the `clientId`/`tenantId`/`subscriptionId` values that Phase 1b stores, and that Phase 2/4/deploy use to authenticate to Azure.
- Phase 2, X, and deploy will always fail without `AZUREAPPSERVICE_*` secrets (which Phase 1b writes).

**Sequence required**: Phase 0 → Phase 1a → Phase 1b → Phase 2 → Phase 3

> **After Phase 1a + 1b run once**, Phase 1a does not need to run again. The `AZUREAPPSERVICE_*` secrets persist in GitHub and are reused by Phase 2 and Phase 3 automatically.

---

### ❓ FAQ: Is the Azure OIDC Login Shared Across Phases? Why Does It Appear Multiple Times?

**Question**: You said Phase 1b doesn't use Azure OIDC. Does that mean Phase 1a, 2, and 3 use the SAME login mechanism? Why does it appear in multiple places?

**Answer**: Yes — `azure/login@v2` with the same three OIDC credentials is the **consistent, commonized mechanism** for all Azure operations. The reason it appears in multiple jobs is a GitHub Actions architectural constraint, not a design choice.

**Why the same login call appears in every job that needs Azure:**  
GitHub Actions jobs run on completely isolated, fresh virtual machine runners. An Azure login from one job is not available to another job. Every job that needs to interact with Azure must call `azure/login@v2` independently — this is required by design, not duplication.

**Which jobs call `azure/login@v2`:**

| Job | Login called? | Login method |
|-----|--------------|--------------|
| `setup-oidc` (Phase 1a, **first-time**) | ❌ No — device code instead | `az login --use-device-code` (user enters code) |
| `setup-oidc` (Phase 1a, **re-run**) | ✅ Yes | `azure/login@v2` (same as Phase 2) |
| `configure-github-secrets` (Phase 1b) | ❌ No | GitHub App token only |
| `bootstrap-dev` (Phase 2) | ✅ Yes | `azure/login@v2` + Validate + Verify |
| `bootstrap-staging` (Phase 2) | ✅ Yes | `azure/login@v2` + Validate + Verify |
| `bootstrap-prod` (Phase 2) | ✅ Yes | `azure/login@v2` + Validate + Verify |
| `deploy-api-to-azure` | ✅ Yes | `azure/login@v2` + credential gate |
| `deploy-ui-to-azure` | ✅ Yes | `azure/login@v2` + credential gate |
| `cleanup-dev/staging/prod` (Phase X) | ✅ Yes | `azure/login@v2` + delete resources |

**The "user input → Azure token" step exists only once (Phase 1a, first-time):**  
The device-code step in Phase 1a (`az login --use-device-code`) is the single point where a human provides credentials to generate an Azure token. This runs exactly once. All subsequent logins — Phase 1a re-runs, Phase 2, Phase X, deploy — are fully automated via OIDC.

**Two login patterns used in the workflow:**
- **Phase 2 (bootstrap jobs)**: 3-step — `Validate Azure Credentials` → `Azure Login (OIDC or Secrets)` → `Verify Azure Login`. This verifies credentials before AND after the login.
- **Phase X (cleanup jobs)**: Same 3-step pattern as bootstrap.
- **Deploy jobs**: 2-step — `Check Azure Credentials` (sets a conditional flag) → `Login to Azure` (only runs if credentials are present). All subsequent deploy steps are gated on the same flag.

### Workflow Steps
1. **Validate Inputs** - Check configuration
2. **Setup Azure OIDC** (optional) - First-time Azure authentication setup
3. **Setup GitHub App** (optional) - One-time GitHub App setup instructions
4. **Configure Secrets** - Auto-configure GitHub secrets using GitHub App
5. **Bootstrap Infrastructure** - Deploy Azure resources
6. **Cleanup Infrastructure** (optional, destructive) - Delete all resources

### Prerequisites Validation
The workflow checks:
- ✅ OIDC setup completed (if enabled)
- ✅ GitHub App secrets present (APP_ID, APP_PRIVATE_KEY)
- ✅ GitHub App installed on repository
- ✅ GitHub App permissions (Secrets: Read and write)

### Common Failure Points
1. **Step 2 (Generate GitHub App Token)** → App not installed → See [TROUBLESHOOTING-GITHUB-APP-404.md](./TROUBLESHOOTING-GITHUB-APP-404.md)
2. **Step 1 (Azure Login)** → Device code timeout → Re-run with "Setup OIDC" enabled

## 🛡️ Preventing Configuration Copy-Paste Errors

### The Problem
A critical copy-paste error on this project resulted in `bootstrap-dev` being accidentally configured with prod environment settings — it would have deployed prod resources when dev was selected.

### Manual Verification Checklist (After Any Workflow Edit)
- [ ] `bootstrap-dev` calls `-Environment dev` and logs show `dev.json`
- [ ] `bootstrap-staging` calls `-Environment staging` and logs show `staging.json`
- [ ] `bootstrap-prod` calls `-Environment prod` and logs show `prod.json`
- [ ] OIDC setup uses `${{ inputs.environment }}` (dynamic, not hardcoded)
- [ ] Configure-secrets uses `${{ inputs.environment }}`

### Automated Fix
```powershell
# Run EVERY TIME before committing workflow changes
./Resources/Azure-Deployment/validate-workflow-config.ps1
# Exit Code 0 = ✅ Safe to commit | Exit Code 1 = ❌ Fix first
```

### Safe Commit Pattern
```powershell
# After each environment change (don't batch):
./Resources/Azure-Deployment/validate-workflow-config.ps1
git add .github/workflows/
git commit -m "fix: Update bootstrap-dev configuration"
```

## ❌ GitHub Secrets 403 Error (GITHUB_TOKEN Limitation)

### Error
```
failed to fetch public key: HTTP 403: Resource not accessible by integration
Error: Failed to set AZUREAPPSERVICE_CLIENTID
```

### Root Cause
`GITHUB_TOKEN` is read-only for secrets — it **cannot** write repository secrets. This is a GitHub security design. The workflow must use a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** with `repo` scope instead.

### Solution
1. Create a PAT at https://github.com/settings/tokens/new (scope: `repo`)
2. Add it as repository secret named `GH_PAT`
3. Re-run bootstrap workflow — it will use `GH_PAT` for `gh secret set` commands

### Secrets That Require PAT
- `AZUREAPPSERVICE_CLIENTID`
- `AZUREAPPSERVICE_TENANTID`
- `AZUREAPPSERVICE_SUBSCRIPTIONID`

These are required by `deploy-api-to-azure.yml`, `deploy-ui-to-azure.yml`, and `infra-deploy.yml` for Azure login.
