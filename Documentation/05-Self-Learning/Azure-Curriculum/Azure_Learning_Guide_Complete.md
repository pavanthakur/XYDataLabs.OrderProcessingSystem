# SECTION 5: TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

## **🐛 Common Issues and Solutions**

**📖 Complete Troubleshooting Guide:** See `Documentation/02-Azure-Learning-Guides/AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` Section "Troubleshooting" for detailed solutions including OIDC authentication issues.

### **Issue 1: GitHub Actions Workflow Fails**

**Symptom:** Workflow shows red X, deployment fails

**Common Causes & Solutions:**

1. **Build Fails:**
   ```
   Error: Project not found at path
   ```
   **Solution:** Verify `PROJECT_PATH` in workflow matches actual project location

2. **Authentication Fails:**
   ```
   Error: Login failed
   ```
   **Solution:**
   - Check GitHub secrets are set correctly
   - Re-authorize GitHub in Azure Deployment Center
   - Verify client-id, tenant-id, subscription-id match

3. **Publish Fails:**
   ```
   Error: NuGet package restore failed
   ```
   **Solution:**
   - Ensure all NuGet packages are available
   - Check network connectivity during build
   - Add `--no-cache` flag to dotnet restore

**Debugging Steps:**
1. Click on failed workflow in GitHub Actions
2. Expand failed step
3. Read error message carefully
4. Check workflow file for typos
5. Verify all paths and names match your setup

---

### **Issue 2: Application Not Accessible (404/500 Errors)**

**Symptom:** Opening Web App URL shows error page

**404 Not Found:**
- **Cause:** Application not deployed or wrong URL
- **Solution:**
  - Verify deployment completed successfully
  - Check URL spelling
  - Ensure application published to wwwroot for UI

**500 Internal Server Error:**
- **Cause:** Application crash or configuration error
- **Solution:**
  - Check Application Insights logs
  - View Log Stream in Azure Portal
  - Verify connection strings and settings
  - Enable detailed errors in staging

**Debugging Steps:**
1. Azure Portal → Your Web App → Log stream
2. Look for startup errors
3. Check Application settings are correct
4. Verify runtime stack matches (.NET 8)
5. Review deployment logs in Deployment Center

---

### **Issue 3: UI Cannot Connect to API**

**Symptom:** UI loads but shows errors when accessing data

**CORS Errors:**
```
Access to fetch blocked by CORS policy
```
**Solution:**
- Add CORS configuration in API `Program.cs`:
```csharp
builder.Services.AddCors(options =>
{
    options.AddDefaultPolicy(policy =>
    {
        policy.WithOrigins("https://orderprocessing-ui-yourname.azurewebsites.net")
              .AllowAnyHeader()
              .AllowAnyMethod();
    });
});

// After app is built:
app.UseCors();
```

**Wrong API URL:**
- **Solution:** Verify `ApiSettings__BaseUrl` in UI settings points to correct API URL

**Network/DNS Issues:**
- **Solution:** Test API directly in browser first, then test UI

---

### **Issue 4: Secrets Not Available in GitHub**

**Symptom:** Workflow can't find Azure credentials

**Solution:**
1. Go to GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Verify these secrets exist:
   - `AZUREAPPSERVICE_CLIENTID`
   - `AZUREAPPSERVICE_TENANTID`
   - `AZUREAPPSERVICE_SUBSCRIPTIONID`
3. If missing, re-configure Deployment Center in Azure
4. Or manually create secrets using Azure CLI

---

### **Issue 5: Application Insights Not Showing Data**

**Symptom:** No telemetry in Application Insights dashboard

**Solution:**
1. Verify connection string is set in application settings
2. Confirm NuGet package is installed
3. Check `AddApplicationInsightsTelemetry()` is called in Program.cs
4. Wait 2-5 minutes for initial telemetry to appear
5. Generate traffic to your application
6. Check Application Insights → Live Metrics

---

### **Issue 6: Deployment Slot Errors**

**Symptom:** Cannot create or swap deployment slots

**Solution:**
