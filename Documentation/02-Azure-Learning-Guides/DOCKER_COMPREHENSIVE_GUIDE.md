## 🚀 Enterprise Deployment Commands

### Azure-Ready Deployments (Default)
```powershell
# Navigate to Docker folder first
cd Resources\Docker

# Enterprise-grade fresh builds (recommended for all environments)
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment dev -Profile http     # Fresh build every time
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment uat -Profile https    # UAT with security
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment prod -Profile https   # Production deployment

# Enterprise mode with additional safeguards
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment prod -Profile https -EnterpriseMode -BackupFirst
 
# CI-friendly strict startup (health enforced, pre-pull errors fatal)
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment dev -Profile http -Strict
```

### Development Speed Mode (Optional)
```powershell
# Legacy mode for rapid development cycles (use sparingly)
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment dev -Profile http -LegacyBuild
```

### 🎯 **Enterprise Recommendations**
- **Production**: Always use default behavior (fresh builds)
- **UAT**: Always use default behavior for testing reliability  
- **Development**: Use default for consistency, `-LegacyBuild` only when needed for speed
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Never use `-LegacyBuild` in automated deployments

### ⏳ First-Time Setup: Base Image Download

**Important**: The first time you run the `./start-docker.ps1` script on a new machine, it will download the required .NET base images (`mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0` and `aspnet:8.0`). This is a **one-time process** that can take **5-15 minutes** depending on your network speed.

The script now provides detailed progress messages, including timers and status updates. Please be patient and do not interrupt the process. Subsequent builds will be much faster as the images will be cached locally.

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### Immediate Startup Commands

```powershell
# Navigate to Docker folder
cd Resources\Docker

# Optional first-run bootstrap: copy .env.local.example to .env.local and set local-only secrets
Copy-Item .env.local.example .env.local

# Development - HTTP (Most Common)
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment dev -Profile http

# Development - HTTPS with SSL
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment dev -Profile https

# UAT Testing
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment uat -Profile https

# Production (Enterprise Mode Recommended)
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment prod -Profile https -EnterpriseMode -BackupFirst

# CI/local strict startup (require health to pass)
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment dev -Profile http -Strict
```

### Local Secret File

`Resources\Docker\.env.local` is the local Docker secret source. It is gitignored and should contain:

```text
LOCAL_SQL_PASSWORD=<local-sql-password>
LOCAL_CERT_PASSWORD=<local-cert-password>
LOCAL_OPENPAY_MERCHANT_ID=<local-openpay-merchant-id>
LOCAL_OPENPAY_PRIVATE_KEY=<local-openpay-private-key>
LOCAL_OPENPAY_DEVICE_SESSION_ID=<local-openpay-device-session-id>
```

If `.env.local` is missing, `start-docker.ps1` now prompts once for each required value and writes the file for future runs.

### Stop Services
```powershell
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment dev -Profile http -Down
```

### ✅ **FULLY RESOLVED: Visual Studio Docker Profile Issues**

**Previous Issue**: Visual Studio docker dev profiles failed with:
- ❌ `network xy-database-network declared as external, but could not be found`
- ❌ `Cannot open database "OrderProcessingSystem_Dev" requested by the login`
- ❌ OpenPay service initialization failures

**✅ Complete Solution Applied**: All Docker profiles (dev, uat, prod) now work seamlessly with Visual Studio F5 debugging and command line execution.

**✅ What's Fixed**:
1. **Docker Networks**: Automatic creation of both `xy-dev-network`, `xy-uat-network`, `xy-prod-network`, and `xy-database-network`
2. **Database Initialization**: Entity Framework migrations run automatically during startup
3. **Database Seeding**: 120 customers and OpenPay provider seeded on first run
4. **SSL/HTTPS Support**: Both HTTP and HTTPS profiles work correctly
5. **Multi-Environment**: Dev, UAT, and Production environments fully functional

**✅ Verified Working Commands**:
```powershell
# Navigate to Docker scripts folder
cd Resources\Docker

# All these commands now work perfectly from clean state:
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment dev -Profile http    # ✅ Working
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment dev -Profile https   # ✅ Working  
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment uat -Profile http    # ✅ Working
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment uat -Profile https   # ✅ Working
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment prod -Profile http   # ✅ Working
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment prod -Profile https  # ✅ Working

# ✅ Smart Container Detection: Re-running commands is safe
# Script automatically detects when containers are already running
# No more "Docker Compose failed to start" errors when containers exist

# Visual Studio Launch Profiles (F5 Debugging):
# - docker-dev-http     ✅ Working
# - docker-dev-https    ✅ Working
# - docker-uat-http     ✅ Working  
# - docker-uat-https    ✅ Working
# - docker-prod-http    ✅ Working
# - docker-prod-https   ✅ Working
```

**✅ Database Creation Verified**:
- `OrderProcessingSystem_Dev` - ✅ Created with 120 customers
- `OrderProcessingSystem_UAT` - ✅ Created with 120 customers  
- `OrderProcessingSystem_Prod` - ✅ Created with 120 customers

### 🏷️ Container Naming Convention

The system uses a standardized naming convention for better organization and management:

**Naming Pattern**: `{service}-{environment}-{protocol}`

#### Container Architecture Summary
- **6 containers per environment** (total of 18 containers across all environments)
- **Clear naming**: `api-{env}-{protocol}-1`, `ui-{env}-{protocol}-1`
- **Proper dependencies**: UI services depend on corresponding API services
- **Environment isolation**: Each environment operates independently
- **Protocol separation**: HTTP and HTTPS services clearly distinguished

#### Development Environment Containers
- `api-dev-http-1` → API HTTP service (port 5020)
- `api-dev-https-1` → API HTTPS service (port 5021)
- `ui-dev-http-1` → UI HTTP service (port 5022)
- `ui-dev-https-1` → UI HTTPS service (port 5023)

#### UAT Environment Containers
- `api-uat-http-1` → API HTTP service (port 5030)
- `api-uat-https-1` → API HTTPS service (port 5031)
- `ui-uat-http-1` → UI HTTP service (port 5032)
- `ui-uat-https-1` → UI HTTPS service (port 5033)

#### Production Environment Containers
- `api-prod-http-1` → API HTTP service (port 5040)
- `api-prod-https-1` → API HTTPS service (port 5041)
- `ui-prod-http-1` → UI HTTP service (port 5042)
- `ui-prod-https-1` → UI HTTPS service (port 5043)

#### Container Naming Benefits
- Clear service identification across environments
- Protocol distinction for HTTP/HTTPS services
- Environment separation preventing conflicts
- Automatic scaling support with numbered containers
- Simplified monitoring and debugging

### 🖼️ Docker Image Naming Convention

The system uses protocol-specific image naming for complete architectural consistency:

**Naming Pattern**: `xydatalabs-orderprocessingsystem-{service}-{protocol}:{environment}`

#### Image Architecture Examples
- **Development**: `xydatalabs-orderprocessingsystem-api-http:dev`
- **Development**: `xydatalabs-orderprocessingsystem-api-https:dev`
- **Development**: `xydatalabs-orderprocessingsystem-ui-http:dev`
- **Development**: `xydatalabs-orderprocessingsystem-ui-https:dev`
- **UAT**: `xydatalabs-orderprocessingsystem-api-http:uat`
- **Production**: `xydatalabs-orderprocessingsystem-ui-https:prod`

#### Image Naming Benefits
- Perfect alignment with container naming convention
- Clear protocol separation in image registry
- Environment-specific versioning and deployments
- Simplified CI/CD pipeline automation
- Enhanced Docker registry organization
- Improved deployment traceability
- **Protocol-specific image preservation** - Starting one profile (HTTP/HTTPS) preserves images from other protocols

## 🚀 Azure Container Apps Readiness
### *Your Docker Excellence Translates Perfectly*

### **🎯 Azure Compatibility Analysis**

#### **✅ What Works Perfectly for Azure:**

1. **Docker Multi-Stage Builds**: Your Dockerfiles use proper multi-stage builds with `base`, `build`, `publish`, and `final` stages - this is Azure Container Registry best practice.

2. **Environment Configuration Strategy**: Your `dev`/`uat`/`prod` environment separation aligns perfectly with Azure Container Apps environment management.

3. **Configuration Management**: Your `sharedsettings.$Environment.json` pattern translates seamlessly to Azure Key Vault and Container Apps environment variables.

4. **Network Isolation**: Your environment-specific networks (`xy-dev-network`, `xy-uat-network`) map directly to Azure Container Apps environments.

5. **Port Configuration**: Your configurable port strategy works perfectly with Azure Container Apps ingress configuration.

### **🔄 Migration Strategy - What Changes (Minimal)**

#### **1. Local Development (No Changes)**
Your Visual Studio Docker profiles continue to work exactly as fixed:
```json
"docker-dev-http": {
  "commandLineArgs": "-NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command \"& '$(SolutionDir)Resources\\Docker\\start-docker.ps1' -Environment dev -Profile http\""
}
```

#### **2. CI/CD Deployment (Automatic)**
Your `start-docker.ps1` script won't be used in Azure - instead:
- **Azure Container Registry** stores your images
- **Azure Container Apps** runs them
- **Azure DevOps/GitHub Actions** orchestrates deployment

#### **3. Configuration Migration**
Your existing configuration pattern migrates seamlessly:

**Current (Local):**
```json
// sharedsettings.dev.json

### 🔧 Enhanced Error Handling

The system includes intelligent error detection and **enterprise-ready build process**:

#### Enterprise Build Strategy (Default - Azure-Ready)
**Default Behavior**: All deployments use `--no-cache` builds for maximum reliability
- **Fresh builds every time** - eliminates cache dependencies and stale layers
- **Reproducible deployments** - identical results across environments
- **Security compliance** - always downloads latest dependencies
- **Azure Container Apps compatible** - matches cloud deployment patterns

#### Legacy Build Mode (Development Speed)
**Optional Flag**: Use `-LegacyBuild` for faster development cycles
- **Reuses existing images** when available for speed
- **Development-focused** - faster iteration cycles
- **⚠️ Not recommended** for UAT/Production environments
- **Warning messages** clearly indicate non-enterprise mode

#### Smart Image Cleanup Logic
When image conflicts occur during builds, the system:
- **Only removes images for the current profile** being started
- **Preserves images from other protocols** (HTTP images preserved when starting HTTPS)
- Performs legacy image cleanup for migration support
- Provides detailed cleanup status information

**Example**: Starting HTTPS profile only removes HTTPS images if conflicts occur, preserving all HTTP images for future use.

#### Container Dependency Management
All service dependencies are correctly configured:
```yaml
# Example: UI waits for API to be healthy
depends_on:
  api-dev-http:
    condition: service_healthy
```

#### Container Management Commands
```powershell
# View all containers with new naming
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}"

# Check specific environment containers
docker ps --filter "name=api-dev"
docker ps --filter "name=ui-uat"

# Debug specific containers
docker logs api-dev-http-1
docker logs ui-uat-https-1

# Visual Studio debugging targets
# Container target: api-dev-http-1 (or api-dev-https-1 for HTTPS)
# Service: XYDataLabs.OrderProcessingSystem.API
```

## 🗄️ Database Environment Strategy

> **🎯 Critical**: Different environments use completely separate databases to prevent conflicts and ensure proper isolation.

### 📊 Database Separation Matrix

| **Development Mode** | **Database Name** | **Server** | **Ports** | **Configuration File** | **Launch Method** |
|---------------------|-------------------|------------|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Visual Studio Non-Docker** | `OrderProcessingSystem_Local` | `localhost,1433` | 5010-5013 | `sharedsettings.local.json` | F5 → http/https profile |
| **Docker Dev** | `OrderProcessingSystem_Dev` | `host.docker.internal,1433` | 5020-5023 | `sharedsettings.dev.json` | F5 → docker-dev-* profile |
| **Docker UAT** | `OrderProcessingSystem_UAT` | `host.docker.internal,1433` | 5030-5033 | `sharedsettings.uat.json` | F5 → docker-uat-* profile |
| **Docker Prod** | `OrderProcessingSystem_Prod` | `host.docker.internal,1433` | 5040-5043 | `sharedsettings.prod.json` | F5 → docker-prod-* profile |

### 🔧 Automatic Environment Setup

#### **Non-Docker (Visual Studio F5)**
When you select **http** or **https** profile in Visual Studio:

1. **Script Execution**: `set-local-env.ps1` runs automatically
2. **Environment Setup**: `.env` file updated with:
   ```properties
   # Local development configuration
   API_HTTP_PORT=5010
   API_HTTPS_PORT=5011
   UI_HTTP_PORT=5012
   UI_HTTPS_PORT=5013
   ConnectionStrings__OrderProcessingSystemDbConnection=Server=localhost,1433;Database=OrderProcessingSystem_Local;...
   ```
3. **Database**: `OrderProcessingSystem_Local` created on localhost SQL Server
4. **Launch**: Application starts on ports 5010-5013

#### **Docker (Visual Studio F5)**
When you select **docker-dev-http** or similar profile in Visual Studio:

1. **Script Execution**: `start-docker.ps1` runs automatically with appropriate environment
2. **Environment Setup**: `.env` file updated with environment-specific ports
3. **Database**: Environment-specific database created (e.g., `OrderProcessingSystem_Dev`)
4. **Launch**: Docker containers start on environment-specific ports

### ⚡ Quick Database Verification

```powershell
# Check all databases
sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P <LOCAL_SQL_PASSWORD> -Q "SELECT name FROM sys.databases WHERE name LIKE 'OrderProcessingSystem%'"

# Expected Results:
# OrderProcessingSystem_Local  (Non-Docker)
# OrderProcessingSystem_Dev    (Docker Dev)
# OrderProcessingSystem_UAT    (Docker UAT)  
# OrderProcessingSystem_Prod   (Docker Prod)
```

### 🚀 Benefits of This Strategy

- **🔄 No Conflicts**: Each development mode has its own database
- **🧪 Independent Testing**: Changes in one environment don't affect others
- **👥 Team Development**: Multiple developers can work simultaneously
- **🛡️ Data Safety**: Production-like data isolated from development changes
- **⚡ Easy Switching**: F5 debugging works correctly for all scenarios

### 🔍 Troubleshooting Database Issues

If you encounter database connection issues:

1. **Verify SQL Server is running** on localhost:1433
2. **Check the .env file** has correct connection string
3. **Confirm database exists** using verification commands above
4. **Re-run environment setup**:
   ```powershell
   # For non-Docker
   .\set-local-env.ps1 -ProjectType API -Profile http
   
   # For Docker dev
   .\start-docker.ps1 -Environment dev -Profile http
   ```

## 📖 Command Reference

### Script Parameters

| Parameter | Values | Default | Description |
|-----------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `-Environment` | `dev`, `uat`, `prod` | `dev` | Target environment |
| `-Profile` | `http`, `https`, `all` | `http` | Services to start (HTTP only, HTTPS only, or both) |
| `-Down` | Switch | False | Stop services (teardown for environment/profile) |
| `-LegacyBuild` | Switch | False | Reuse existing images for speed (dev only recommended) |
| `-Strict` | Switch | False | CI-grade: retries + fallback warming for base images; enforce health wait (timeout via `-HealthTimeoutSec`) and normalize exit codes |
| `-HealthTimeoutSec` | Integer | `90` | Health wait timeout (applies when `-Strict` or `-LegacyBuild`) |
| `-NoPrePull` | Switch | False | Skip base image pre-pull warm step |
| `-Reset` | Switch | False | Stop stack + remove images for selected profile before start (clean rebuild) |
| `-EnterpriseMode` | Switch | False | Enable enterprise networks, logging, backup policies |
| `-ConservativeClean` | Switch | False | Enterprise: reduce cleanup aggressiveness (UAT/Prod) |
| `-PreservePersistentData` | Switch | False | Enterprise: preserve labeled persistent volumes |
| `-BackupFirst` | Switch | False | Enterprise: force backup prior to start (recommended for prod) |
| `-SharedSettingsPath` | File path | Auto | Override path to `sharedsettings.{env}.json` |
| `-EnvFilePath` | File path | (unused) | Reserved for future environment file generation |
| `-Help` | Switch | False | Display inline usage/help and exit |

### Parameter Simplification (Migration)

Deprecated (Removed) | Replacement / Behavior Now
---------------------|---------------------------------------------
`-PrePullRetryCount` | Automatic retries in `-Strict` (3 attempts)
`-UseBuildFallbackForPrePull` | Automatic build-based fallback in `-Strict`
`-FailOnPrePullError` | Implied by `-Strict` (fatal on failure)
`-WaitForHealthy` | Implied by `-Strict` and `-LegacyBuild`
`-CleanImages` | Use `-Reset` for clean profile image rebuild

Rationale: These granular resilience flags were consolidated to reduce cognitive load. Strict mode now encapsulates robust base image acquisition (retry + fallback) and health enforcement. For full rebuilds use `-Reset`. To skip initial warm pulls use `-NoPrePull`.

### Profile Options

| Profile | Services Started | Use Case |
|---------|------------------|----------|
| `http` | API + UI (HTTP only) | Development, quick testing |
| `https` | API + UI (HTTPS only) | SSL testing, secure development |
| `all` | API + UI (HTTP + HTTPS) | Full testing, production |

## 🔧 Standard Mode Operations

### Basic Operations
```powershell
# Start development with HTTP
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment dev -Profile http

# Start with HTTPS (requires certificates)
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment dev -Profile https

# Start all services (HTTP + HTTPS)
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment uat -Profile all

# Stop services
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment dev -Profile http -Down
```

### With Cache Management
```powershell
# Clean cache before starting (full cleanup)
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment dev -Profile https

# This automatically runs:
# 1. docker system prune -f --volumes
# 2. Starts the specified environment
```

### Environment-Specific Examples
```powershell
# Development - Fast iteration
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment dev -Profile http

# UAT - Production-like testing
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment uat -Profile all

# Production - Stable deployment
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment prod -Profile https
```

### Strict Mode (-Strict)

Use `-Strict` for CI-grade determinism and resilient startup:

* Automatic base image retries (3 attempts) plus build-based fallback warming if pulls fail.
* Fatal on unresolved base image acquisition (script exits with error if images cannot be obtained).
* Enforced health wait: containers must reach Running/Healthy within `-HealthTimeoutSec` (default 90s) or the script fails and prints recent logs.
* Normalizes docker-compose stderr status noise: exit code 0 when services are healthy.
* Combine with `-LegacyBuild` for faster local strict runs (image reuse + health enforcement).

### Compose v2 Auto-Detection (Nov 16 2025)

The `start-docker.ps1` script automatically chooses the appropriate Docker Compose form:

| Condition | Selected Form | Why |
|-----------|---------------|-----|
| Plugin available (Docker Desktop ≥ v2) | `docker compose` | Official v2, maintained forward |
| Only legacy binary present | `docker-compose` | Backward compatibility |
| Both present | `docker compose` | Prefers v2 to avoid deprecation |
| None present | Error & exit | Requires installing Docker Desktop / Compose plugin |

You may use either syntax manually; examples below now prefer `docker compose`. CI runners (GitHub Actions Ubuntu) usually expose only the v2 plugin—this change removes prior failures where `docker-compose` was missing. If you receive a "Docker Compose not found" error, install or update Docker.

Manual log examples (interchangeable):
```powershell
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f api
```

Examples:
```powershell
# Fast local reuse + strict health
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment dev -Profile http -LegacyBuild -Strict

# Fresh strict build (recommended for CI/UAT)
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment uat -Profile https -Strict

# Production dry run (health gated)
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment prod -Profile https -Strict
```

### Reset vs. NoPrePull

| Scenario | Use |
|----------|-----|
| Need clean rebuild for a single profile (HTTP or HTTPS) | `-Reset` |
| Skipping base image warm step on a fast network or after recent pulls | `-NoPrePull` |
| Flaky network / CI reliability | `-Strict` (handles retries + fallback) |

### Quick Migration Examples

Old Command | New Command
------------|------------
`-PrePullRetryCount 5 -UseBuildFallbackForPrePull` | `-Strict` (built-in resilience)
`-FailOnPrePullError` | `-Strict`
`-CleanImages -Down` | `-Reset`
`-WaitForHealthy` | `-Strict` or implicit with `-LegacyBuild`

### Help Output

Inline usage is available:
```powershell
.\start-docker.ps1 -Help
```

## �🔍 Troubleshooting

### ✅ **RESOLVED: Visual Studio Docker Profile Startup Issues**

**Issue**: Visual Studio docker dev profile failed with database and network errors.

**Root Causes Identified & Fixed**:
1. **Missing xy-database-network**: Docker Compose expected `xy-database-network` but script only created environment-specific networks
2. **Lazy Database Initialization**: Database migrations only ran when AppMasterData was first accessed, not during startup
3. **EnsureCreated vs Migrations**: Code used `EnsureCreated()` instead of proper `Migrate()` for Entity Framework

**✅ Complete Solution Applied**:

#### 1. **Fixed Network Creation** in `start-docker.ps1`
Added automatic `xy-database-network` creation:
```powershell
# Ensure database network exists for all environments
$result = docker network ls --filter "name=xy-database-network" --format "{{.Name}}" | Where-Object { $_ -eq "xy-database-network" }
if (-not $result) {
    Write-ColoredOutput "Creating Docker network: xy-database-network..." "Yellow" "INFO"
    $createResult = docker network create xy-database-network 2>&1
    if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
        Write-ColoredOutput "Network 'xy-database-network' created successfully" "Green" "SUCCESS"
    }
}
```

#### 2. **Fixed Database Migration** in `DbInitializer.cs`  
Changed from `EnsureCreated()` to `Migrate()`:
```csharp
public static void Initialize(OrderProcessingSystemDbContext context)
{
    // Apply all pending migrations and create database if it doesn't exist
    context.Database.Migrate();
    // ... rest of seeding logic
}
```

#### 3. **Fixed Startup Initialization** in `Program.cs`
Added explicit database initialization during application startup:
```csharp
var app = builder.Build();

// Initialize database and AppMasterData during startup  
using (var scope = app.Services.CreateScope())
{
    try
    {
        var appMasterData = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<AppMasterData>();
        Log.Information("Database initialized and AppMasterData loaded successfully during startup");
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Log.Fatal(ex, "Failed to initialize database during startup");
        throw;
    }
}
```

**✅ Verification Results**:
- ✅ All 6 Entity Framework migrations applied automatically
- ✅ OrderProcessingSystem_Dev, OrderProcessingSystem_UAT, OrderProcessingSystem_Prod databases created
- ✅ 120 customers seeded in each database
- ✅ OpenPay PaymentProvider seeded successfully
- ✅ All Docker networks (xy-dev-network, xy-uat-network, xy-prod-network, xy-database-network) auto-created
- ✅ Visual Studio F5 debugging works with all docker profiles

### Common Issues

#### ⚠️ Base Image Pull Failures (Critical)
**Symptom**: The build fails with an error like `Build failed and required images are missing` or `failed to resolve reference "mcr.microsoft.com/..."`.

**Root Cause**: This almost always means your Docker environment cannot download the required base images (e.g., `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0`) from the internet. This can happen if you manually deleted the images and your machine is behind a restrictive firewall or proxy.

**Do NOT manually delete base images unless you are certain you can re-download them.**

**Solution**:
1.  **Confirm the network issue**: Run `docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0`. If this fails, the problem is your machine's network configuration, not the project scripts.
2.  **Check Docker Settings**: Investigate `Settings > Proxies` and `Settings > Network` in Docker Desktop.
3.  **Offline Recovery**: If you cannot fix the network issue, you must manually load the images.
    - On a machine with internet, run `docker save -o sdk.tar mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0`.
    - Copy the `sdk.tar` file to your machine.
    - On your machine, run `docker load -i sdk.tar`.
    - Repeat for `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0`.

#### 1. Port Already in Use
```powershell
# Check what's using the port
netstat -ano | findstr :5000

# Kill the process (replace PID)
taskkill /PID 1234 /F

# Or use different ports by modifying sharedsettings.{env}.json
```

#### 2. Network Issues  
```powershell
# List Docker networks
docker network ls

# Remove problematic network
docker network rm xynetwork

# Script will recreate automatically on next run
```

**✅ Common Network Error RESOLVED**: `network xy-database-network declared as external, but could not be found`
- **Root Cause**: Clean cache removes networks, but Docker Compose expects specific network names
- **✅ Solution Applied**: Automatic network creation in start-docker.ps1 script
- **✅ Verification**: All environments tested and working

#### 3. SSL Certificate Issues
```powershell
# Regenerate certificates
dotnet dev-certs https --clean
dotnet dev-certs https -ep ./Resources/Certificates/aspnetapp.pfx -p <local-cert-password>
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

#### 4. Configuration File Missing
```powershell
# Check if file exists
Test-Path sharedsettings.dev.json

# The script will show error with expected file path
```

### Debug Mode
```powershell
# Add verbose output
$VerbosePreference = "Continue"
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment dev -Profile http -Verbose
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Details

### Port Configuration
Ports are automatically extracted from `sharedsettings.{env}.json`:

```json
{
  "ApiSettings": {
    "API": {
      "http": { "Port": 5000 },
      "https": { "Port": 5001 }
    },
    "UI": {
      "http": { "Port": 5002 },
      "https": { "Port": 5003 }
    }
  }
}
```

### Generated .env File
The script automatically generates:
```
# Port configuration extracted from sharedsettings.json
# Generated on 2025-08-03 15:30:45
# Environment: dev
API_HTTP_PORT=5000
API_HTTPS_PORT=5001
UI_HTTP_PORT=5002
UI_HTTPS_PORT=5003
```

### Docker Compose Files
- `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Development configuration
- `docker-compose.uat.yml` - UAT configuration  
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Production configuration

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Development Workflow
```powershell
# Daily development start
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment dev -Profile http

# Clean start when needed
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment dev -Profile http

# End of day
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment dev -Profile http -Down
```

### Testing Workflow
```powershell
# Start UAT for testing
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment uat -Profile https -EnterpriseMode

# Conservative cleanup if issues
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment uat -Profile https -EnterpriseMode -ConservativeClean

# Stop after testing
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment uat -Profile https -Down
```

### Production Deployment
```powershell
# Always use enterprise mode with backup
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment prod -Profile all -EnterpriseMode -BackupFirst

# For maintenance restarts
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment prod -Profile all -EnterpriseMode -ConservativeClean -PreservePersistentData
```

### Resource Management
```powershell
# Check Docker resource usage
docker system df

# Enterprise cleanup by environment
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment dev -Profile http -EnterpriseMode    # Aggressive
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment uat -Profile http -EnterpriseMode -ConservativeClean  # Conservative  
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment prod -Profile http -EnterpriseMode -ConservativeClean # Minimal
```

## 🏢 Enterprise Mode & Cleanup Policies

The `start-docker.ps1` script supports an enterprise mode with environment-specific cleanup and safety features.

### Enterprise Parameters

| Parameter | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `-Enterprise` | Enable enterprise features (network isolation, backup, logging) |
| `-Strict` | Policy-based enforcement (no user prompts) |
| `-CleanupPolicy` | `aggressive` / `conservative` / `minimal` |
| `-BackupData` | Backup volumes before cleanup |

### Cleanup Policy by Environment

| Environment | Policy | Behavior |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| DEV | `aggressive` | Removes stopped containers, unused images, volumes |
| UAT | `conservative` | Removes stopped containers, keeps images |
| PROD | `minimal` | Only removes explicitly stopped containers |

### Example Enterprise Commands

```powershell
# Development - enterprise mode with aggressive cleanup
.\Resources\Docker\start-docker.ps1 -Environment dev -Enterprise -CleanupPolicy aggressive

# UAT - conservative cleanup with backup
.\Resources\Docker\start-docker.ps1 -Environment uat -Enterprise -CleanupPolicy conservative -BackupData

# Production - strict mode, minimal cleanup
.\Resources\Docker\start-docker.ps1 -Environment prod -Enterprise -Strict -CleanupPolicy minimal
```

### Enterprise Safety Features
- **Production warnings**: Prompts confirmation before prod changes (unless `-Strict`)
- **Network security labels**: Containers labelled with `env=dev|uat|prod` for isolation
- **Data protection**: Volume backups before destructive operations
- **Audit logging**: All enterprise operations logged to `logs/enterprise-standards-log.csv`
