## 🏆 **YOUR ENTERPRISE COMMANDS (PERFECTED)**

### **🌅 Daily Development**
```powershell
# Enterprise development startup
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment dev -Profile http -EnterpriseMode

# End of day cleanup  
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment dev -Profile http -Down
```

### **🧪 Testing & Integration**
```powershell
# UAT environment (production-like)
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment uat -Profile https -EnterpriseMode

# Production validation
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment prod -Profile https -EnterpriseMode -BackupFirst

## ✅ **ENTERPRISE STANDARDS CHECK**

### **Before Every Commit:**
- [ ] **Environment Isolation**: Using dev/uat/prod networks ✅
- [ ] **Configuration External**: No hardcoded values ✅  
- [ ] **Security First**: Non-root containers ✅
- [ ] **Azure Ready**: Multi-stage Dockerfiles ✅

### **Before Every Deployment:**
- [ ] **Backup First**: Production gets `-BackupFirst` flag ✅
- [ ] **Network Isolation**: Environment-specific networks ✅
- [ ] **Health Checks**: All services have health endpoints ✅
- [ ] **Secrets External**: Using sharedsettings pattern ✅

## 🎯 **AZURE CONTAINER APPS READINESS**

### **✅ You're Already Doing This Right:**
- **Multi-Environment Strategy** → Container Apps environments
- **Configuration Management** → Azure Key Vault integration
- **Network Isolation** → Container Apps environment isolation
- **Docker Multi-Stage** → Azure Container Registry optimization
- **Security Practices** → Managed Identity ready

## 🛡️ **ENTERPRISE MANTRAS**

> **"Environment isolation is non-negotiable"**  
> **"Configuration is always externalized"**  
> **"Security is built-in, not bolted-on"**  
> **"What works in dev, works in prod"**  
> **"Azure Container Apps loves our patterns"**

## 🚨 **Red Flags to Avoid**
- ❌ Hardcoded ports or URLs in Dockerfiles
- ❌ Running containers as root user
- ❌ Single environment setup
- ❌ Manual configuration steps
- ❌ Ignoring health checks

## ✅ **Gold Standards You Follow**
- ✅ Environment-specific sharedsettings files
- ✅ Non-root user execution  
- ✅ dev/uat/prod network isolation
- ✅ Automated PowerShell orchestration
- ✅ Comprehensive health monitoring
