# ADR-010: Runtime Environment Detection and Feature Gating

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 2026-03-27

---

## Context

The application runs in five distinct runtime contexts: local VS, local Docker dev, local Docker
staging, local Docker prod, and Azure App Service (dev / stg / prod). Several features must behave
differently depending on the runtime context. Runtime detection is still required for concerns such
as developer exception pages, Azure-only behavior, and local-vs-cloud infrastructure choices.

During staging validation on 2026-04-03, the tenant selector exposed a design flaw: the UI policy
was being inferred from `IsDevelopment` / `IsDocker`, while the desired behavior is a deployment
policy decision that varies by environment and audience. Staging must allow tenant switching for
QA and release verification, while production customer UI must hide that surface and rely on the
configured active tenant unless a system-carried tenant code is supplied as part of a controlled
flow such as payment callback return.

Three environment variables drive all runtime detection:

| Variable | Set by | Value |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` | Docker Compose, Azure App Service config | `Development` / `Staging` / `Production` |
| `DOTNET_RUNNING_IN_CONTAINER` | Dockerfile `ENV` (line 52 / 70) **and** Azure App Service (natively) | `true` |
| `WEBSITE_SITE_NAME` | Azure App Service only | App Service name (e.g. `pavanthakur-orderprocessing-api-xyapp-dev`) |

**Critical constraint:** `DOTNET_RUNNING_IN_CONTAINER=true` is baked into the Dockerfile, so it is
`true` in both local Docker and Azure App Service containers. It **cannot** be used alone to
distinguish local from Azure.

**Reliable local-vs-Azure discriminator:** `WEBSITE_SITE_NAME` — only injected by Azure App
Service; never present in a local Docker or VS run.

---

## Decision

All environment-conditional feature gates use exactly three derived booleans, resolved at startup:

```csharp
// API/Program.cs (and historically the retired MVC host)
var isDocker = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("DOTNET_RUNNING_IN_CONTAINER") == "true";
var azureSiteName = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("WEBSITE_SITE_NAME");
var isAzure = !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(azureSiteName);
// IsDevelopment = ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT == "Development"
```

In the retired MVC UI, these were also exposed as `ViewData` keys (`IsDocker`, `IsAzure`,
`IsDevelopment`) by `HomeController.PopulateCommonViewData()` for use in Razor views. The active
React web client does not use Razor `ViewData`; it consumes runtime configuration from the API.

During the MVC phase, tenant policy flags (`UiSelectorEnabled`, `UiTenantOverrideEnabled`) were
also passed through `ViewData`, but they came from `TenantConfiguration`, not from runtime
detection.

Tenant selector behavior is no longer derived from those booleans. It is controlled by
`TenantConfiguration` so the same deployment can intentionally enable or disable tenant switching
without adding more environment-specific branching in Razor or JavaScript.

```json
"TenantConfiguration": {
  "ActiveTenantCode": "TenantA",
  "UiSelectorEnabled": true,
  "UiTenantOverrideEnabled": true,
  "SwaggerSelectorEnabled": true
}
```

Policy semantics:

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `ActiveTenantCode` | Default tenant when no explicit tenant selection is supplied |
| `UiSelectorEnabled` | Controls whether the web client exposes tenant selector UI |
| `UiTenantOverrideEnabled` | Allows browser-persisted user override; must be `false` if selector is hidden |
| `SwaggerSelectorEnabled` | Injects the Swagger top-bar tenant selector in API Swagger UI |
| URL `tenantCode` query param | Still honored as a request-scoped tenant hint for callback flows, even when browser override is disabled |

## Checklist for New Environment-Conditional Features

When writing any code that behaves differently based on runtime context, validate every cell in
the matrix before merging:

```text
[ ] VS F5 local (IsDevelopment=true, IsDocker=false, IsAzure=false)
[ ] Dev Docker  (IsDevelopment=true, IsDocker=true,  IsAzure=false) — docker-compose.dev.yml
[ ] Stg Docker  (IsDevelopment=false, IsDocker=true, IsAzure=false) — docker-compose.stg.yml
[ ] Prod Docker (IsDevelopment=false, IsDocker=true, IsAzure=false) — docker-compose.prod.yml  (rare but possible)
[ ] Azure dev   (IsDevelopment=true,  IsDocker=true, IsAzure=true)
[ ] Azure stg   (IsDevelopment=false, IsDocker=true, IsAzure=true)
[ ] Azure prod  (IsDevelopment=false, IsDocker=true, IsAzure=true)
```

**Common traps:**

| Trap | Wrong gate | Correct gate |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| "Only show in dev" but need stg Docker too | `IsDevelopment` | `!IsAzure && (IsDevelopment \|\| IsDocker)` |
| "Hide on Azure" but also hide on local prod Docker | `!IsDevelopment` | `IsAzure` |
| "Only in Docker" thinking it excludes Azure | `IsDocker` | `IsDocker && !IsAzure` |
| "Detect Azure" | `IsDocker` ← WRONG, it's true locally too | `IsAzure` (WEBSITE_SITE_NAME) |
| "Tenant switching follows runtime" | `IsDevelopment`, `IsDocker`, or `IsAzure` in Razor/JS | `TenantConfiguration:*` policy keys |

---

## Legacy MVC Note

Do not add new ViewData-driven runtime UI behavior to the retired MVC host. If temporary
compatibility maintenance is ever required, reuse `PopulateCommonViewData()` in `HomeController`
or the same detection pattern below; all active web behavior belongs in `frontend/apps/web` and
`GET /api/v1/Info/runtime-configuration`.

```csharp
var isDocker = string.Equals(Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("DOTNET_RUNNING_IN_CONTAINER"), "true", StringComparison.Ordinal);
var isAzure = !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("WEBSITE_SITE_NAME"));
ViewData["IsDocker"] = isDocker;
ViewData["IsAzure"] = isAzure;
ViewData["IsDevelopment"] = string.Equals(environmentName, Constants.Environments.Dev, StringComparison.Ordinal);
ViewData["UiSelectorEnabled"] = tenantConfigurationOptions.UiSelectorEnabled;
ViewData["UiTenantOverrideEnabled"] = tenantConfigurationOptions.UiTenantOverrideEnabled;
```

Do NOT re-read `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` directly in controllers — go through `ResolveExecutionContext()`.

---

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Single source of truth for runtime detection logic.
- Tenant switching policy is explicit, testable, and environment-configurable across VS local, Docker, and Azure.
- Checklist prevents the stg Docker blind spot and separates runtime concerns from tenancy policy.
- Feature gate inventory makes auditing straightforward.

**Negative / Trade-offs:**
- `WEBSITE_SITE_NAME` is Azure App Service-specific. If the app is ever deployed to AKS or
  Azure Container Apps, this variable is not set automatically — `isAzure` would be `false` and
  Azure-specific behavior would need a new deployment-target signal.
- Tenant selector policy now depends on shared settings correctness. Invalid combinations are
  guarded by startup validation, but misconfigured values still become an operational issue rather
  than a code-path default.

**Future obligations:**
- When deploying to AKS/ACA, re-evaluate the `isAzure` detection strategy and update this ADR.
- When adding any new environment-conditional feature, add a row to the Feature Gate Inventory.
- `AllowProductionUI` CORS origin is currently derived from the API site name by replacing `-api-xyapp-` with `-ui-xyapp-`. If that naming convention changes, update `AddCors` in `API/Program.cs` and this ADR.

## Audit Log

| Date | Auditor | Finding | Action |
|------|---------|---------|--------|
| 2026-03-27 | Checklist audit | UI developer exception page used `!IsDevelopment` without `!isAzure` — Azure dev would serve raw stack traces | Fixed in `UI/Program.cs` (commit cd02192) |
| 2026-03-27 | Checklist audit | API migrations block re-read `WEBSITE_SITE_NAME` into `isAzureRuntime` instead of reusing top-level `isAzure` | Fixed in `API/Program.cs` (commit cd02192) |
| 2026-03-27 | Checklist audit | CORS `AllowAll` policy active in all environments including Azure prod — `AllowPaymentUI` policy commented out | Known tech debt, pre-existing. Needs origin whitelist before Azure prod hardening |
| 2026-03-27 | Checklist audit | Swagger exposed in Azure prod — `TODO: DISABLE SWAGGER IN PRODUCTION` comment in code | Known tech debt, pre-existing |
| 2026-03-27 | Code review | CORS `AllowAll` applied to Azure prod — `SetIsOriginAllowed(_ => true)` with `AllowCredentials()` is dangerous in prod (OWASP A05) | Fixed: added `AllowProductionUI` policy restricting origin to UI App Service domain; applied via `corsPolicy` variable at runtime |
| 2026-03-27 | Code review | Swagger still enabled in Azure prod despite `TODO` comment; `environment == "prod"` block unconditionally called `app.UseSwagger()` | Fixed: prod branch now uses exception handler + HSTS only; `TODO` comment removed |
| 2026-03-27 | Code review | `#if RELEASE` block appended after `public partial class Program { }` — top-level statements illegal after type declarations (`CS8803`); throw would crash every prod startup | Fixed: block removed entirely |
| 2026-03-27 | Checklist audit | `MyApiClient` registered with `http://api:{port}` (Docker hostname) — wrong in Azure since `isDocker=true` there. Never consumed by any controller — dead registration | Low risk (unused). Remove when doing HttpClient cleanup |
| 2026-03-27 | Checklist audit | Log file sink `/logs/webapi-.log` and `/logs/ui-.log` write to ephemeral Azure App Service filesystem | Low risk — App Insights covers Azure logs when connection string present |
| 2026-03-28 | Code review | `local dotnet run` and `docker dev http` both wrote `webapi-dev-http-{date}.log` — file lock conflict when running both simultaneously | Fixed: added `runtimeSuffix` (`dock`/`local`) as third segment. New pattern: `{app}-{env}-{runtime}-{profile}-{date}.log`. Updated `API/Program.cs`, `UI/Program.cs`. |
| 2026-04-03 | Staging verification | Tenant selector policy was hard-coded to `IsDevelopment \|\| IsDocker`, causing code/doc drift and hiding the selector in Azure staging customer UI | Fixed: moved tenant selector and Swagger selector policy into `TenantConfiguration` (`UiSelectorEnabled`, `UiTenantOverrideEnabled`, `SwaggerSelectorEnabled`) and updated shared settings + UI/API gating |
