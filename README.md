# üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How to Run the Project
  1. First make sure that you have **.NET 8.0** and **Visual Studio 2022** are installed.
  2. Now open the solution with VS 2022 and build the solution to make sure that there is no error.
  3. Now choose either of http or https or Docker profile as startup project and then run it. On startup necessary databases will be created in **MSSQLLocalDB**. Along with seed data.
     Note : change sql server IP Address, username and password
  4. Start the project from Visual Studio code with below commands
      Q:\GIT\TestAppXY_OrderProcessingSystem> docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml --profile all up --build --force-recreate
  5. Ensure in Windows Docker Desktop Container "testappxy_orderprocessingsystem" with API and UI Images are loaded. Ensure ports for http and https are correct as below
     Test the APIs using Swagger for all the business use cases.
     i) a. For Docker profile to start API with https -> https://localhost:5001/swagger/index.html
	    b. For Docker profile to start UI with https -> https://localhost:5003/
	 OR
	 ii) a. For Docker profile to start API with http -> http://localhost:5000/swagger/index.html
	     b. For Docker profile to start UI with http -> http://localhost:5002/
	 
   6. To Debug  API with Docker from VS2022
       Debug > AttachToProcess
	   Connection type : Docker (Linux Container)
	   Contaier target : testappxy_orderprocessingsystem-api-1
	   Attach To : XYDataLabs.OrderProcessingSystem.API
	   Code type : Managed (.Net Core for Unix) code
	   (Note : Ensure Debug > Windows > Modules - Symbols are loaded for XYDataLabs.OrderProcessingSystem.API)
   
   7. Open Q:\GIT\TestAppXY_OrderProcessingSystem in VSCode
      To Debug UI application :- Use Run and Debug > Launch Chrome (UI 5003)
