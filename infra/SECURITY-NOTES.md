# Security Notes for Infrastructure Deployment

## ⚠️ Current Security Considerations

This document outlines security considerations for the current infrastructure implementation and provides recommendations for hardening production deployments.

## SQL Database Credentials

### Current Implementation

**Status**: ⚠️ **Development-Only - NOT Production-Ready**

SQL admin credentials are currently stored in plain text in parameter files:
- `infra/parameters/dev.json`
- `infra/parameters/staging.json`
- `infra/parameters/prod.json`

**Why this is acceptable for development:**
- Quick setup and testing
- Credentials are for development environments only
- Simplified troubleshooting
- Common practice in dev/test scenarios

**Why this is NOT acceptable for production:**
- ❌ Credentials exposed in source control
- ❌ Visible to all developers with repo access
- ❌ Visible in deployment logs
- ❌ Violates least-privilege principle
- ❌ Difficult to rotate credentials
- ❌ Compliance issues (SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.)

### Recommended Production Solutions

#### Option 1: Azure Key Vault (Recommended for SQL Auth)

**Implementation:**

1. Store SQL admin password in Key Vault:
```bash
az keyvault secret set --vault-name "kv-orderprocessing-prod" --name "sql-admin-password" --value "YourSecurePassword123!"
```

2. Update parameter file to reference Key Vault:
```json
{
  "sqlAdminPassword": {
    "reference": {
      "keyVault": {
        "id": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{rgName}/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/{vaultName}"
      },
      "secretName": "sql-admin-password"
    }
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Credentials never in source control
- ✅ Centralized secret management
- ✅ Access controlled via RBAC
- ✅ Audit trail of secret access
- ✅ Automatic rotation support
- ✅ Compliance-ready

#### Option 2: Managed Identity (Most Secure - Recommended)

**Implementation:**

1. Enable Managed Identity on App Services (already done if `enableIdentity: true`)

2. Grant App Service Managed Identity access to SQL:
```sql
CREATE USER [app-service-name] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER;
ALTER ROLE db_datareader ADD MEMBER [app-service-name];
ALTER ROLE db_datawriter ADD MEMBER [app-service-name];
```

3. Update connection string to use Managed Identity:
```
Server=tcp:{server}.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog={database};Authentication=Active Directory Managed Identity;Encrypt=True;
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **No passwords needed at all**
- ✅ Azure AD authentication
- ✅ Automatic credential rotation
- ✅ Fine-grained RBAC
- ✅ Best security practice
- ✅ Zero credential management overhead

## SQL Server Network Access

### Current Implementation

**Status**: ⚠️ **Development-Only - Consider Hardening**

SQL Server is configured with:
```bicep
publicNetworkAccess: 'Enabled'
```

Firewall rule allows all Azure services:
```bicep
startIpAddress: '0.0.0.0'
endIpAddress: '0.0.0.0'
```

**Why this is acceptable for development:**
- Easy access from Azure resources
- Simplified initial setup
- Works with App Services without additional networking
- Common for dev/test

**Why you might want to harden for production:**
- ⚠️ Broader attack surface
- ⚠️ Any Azure service can attempt connection
- ⚠️ Compliance requirements may require private connectivity
- ⚠️ Best practice is to minimize exposed services

### Recommended Production Solutions

#### Option 1: Restrict Firewall Rules

Add specific IP ranges instead of allowing all Azure:
```bicep
resource restrictedFirewall 'Microsoft.Sql/servers/firewallRules@2023-08-01-preview' = {
  parent: sqlServer
  name: 'AllowSpecificAppService'
  properties: {
    startIpAddress: '20.x.x.x' // App Service outbound IP
    endIpAddress: '20.x.x.x'
  }
}
```

Get App Service outbound IPs:
```bash
az webapp show --name {app-name} --resource-group {rg} --query "outboundIpAddresses"
```

#### Option 2: Private Endpoint (Most Secure)

1. Disable public network access:
```bicep
publicNetworkAccess: 'Disabled'
```

2. Create Virtual Network and Subnet

3. Create Private Endpoint for SQL Server

4. Integrate App Service with VNet

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No public internet exposure
- ✅ Traffic stays within Azure backbone
- ✅ Enhanced compliance posture
- ✅ Better performance
- ✅ Defense in depth

**Cost**: Additional charges for Private Endpoints (~$7-10/month per endpoint)

## Connection String Exposure

### Current Implementation

**Status**: ⚠️ **Be Aware - Logged in Deployment Outputs**

Connection string (including password) is output from `sql.bicep`:
```bicep
output connectionString string = 'Server=...;Password=${sqlAdminPassword};...'
```

**Risk:**
- Connection string may appear in:
  - Deployment logs
  - Azure Resource Manager operation logs
  - CI/CD pipeline logs

**Mitigation (Current):**
- Connection string is immediately consumed by hosting module
- Not exposed as top-level output in `main.bicep`
- Configured directly in App Service (not exposed to clients)

**Recommendation for Production:**
- Use Managed Identity (eliminates password entirely)
- Use Key Vault references instead of embedding in connection string
- Enable Log Analytics workspace filtering to exclude sensitive data

## Application Insights

### Current Implementation

**Status**: ✅ **Properly Configured**

Application Insights connection string is:
- Generated by Azure (not user-provided)
- Automatically configured in App Services
- Does not contain secrets (uses instrumentation key)
- Properly secured

**No action needed** - App Insights is correctly implemented.

## GitHub OIDC

### Current Implementation

**Status**: ✅ **Secure by Design**

OIDC federated credentials:
- No secrets stored in GitHub
- Token-based authentication
- Short-lived tokens
- Scoped to specific repositories and branches

**No action needed** - OIDC is secure.
