fix: CRITICAL - Fix PowerShell variable parsing in OIDC subject strings

ISSUE: Federated credentials created with WRONG subjects:
- Created: repo:pavanthakur/dev (missing repo name!)
- Created: repo:pavanthakur//heads/dev (missing repo name!)
- Expected: repo:pavanthakur/XYDataLabs.OrderProcessingSystem:ref:refs/heads/dev
- Expected: repo:pavanthakur/XYDataLabs.OrderProcessingSystem:environment:dev

ROOT CAUSE: PowerShell drive path interpretation bug
When using variable followed by colon like Repository:ref
PowerShell treats the colon as a drive separator (like C:)
Result: Variable name gets parsed as drive path and disappears

EXAMPLE OF BUG:
Repository = 'XYDataLabs.OrderProcessingSystem'
subject = "repo:GitHubOwner/Repository:ref:refs/heads/branch"
Result: "repo:pavanthakur//heads/dev" (Repository vanishes!)

FIX: Use PowerShell braced variable syntax to properly delimit
- Changed: "repo:GitHubOwner/Repository:ref:refs/heads/branch"
- To: "repo:GitHubOwnerName/RepositoryName:ref:refs/heads/branchName"
- Using: curly braces around variable names

AFFECTED CODE:
- Line 154: Branch credential subject string
- Line 178: Environment credential subject string  
- Line 119: Expected pattern for validation

VALIDATION:
Before: repo:pavanthakur//heads/dev (WRONG)
After: repo:pavanthakur/XYDataLabs.OrderProcessingSystem:ref:refs/heads/dev (CORRECT)

IMPACT:
This bug caused ALL OIDC authentication to fail because subjects did not match
GitHub actual subject format. Bootstrap would always fail at Azure login.

ADDED: Debug logging to show received parameters for troubleshooting.
