## Section 1: Environment-Specific Docker Configuration

Here's an evaluation of the environment-specific docker-compose files:

### Environment Structure
- **docker-compose.dev.yml** - Development environment with hot reload and debugging
- **docker-compose.uat.yml** - UAT/Staging environment for production-like testing  
- **docker-compose.prod.yml** - Production environment with optimized settings

### Common Features Across Environments
- Defines four services: api, api-https, ui, ui-https.
- Uses profiles (http, https, all, etc.) for flexible service selection.
- Correctly sets environment variables for each service, including API_BASE_URL for UI and UI-HTTPS.
- Exposes the right ports for HTTP and HTTPS.
- Uses Docker service names (e.g., api, api-https) for internal communication, which is best practice.
- Healthchecks and networks are set up properly with environment-specific network names.

### Environment-Specific Configurations
- **Development**: Volume mounts for source code, hot reload enabled, debugging settings
- **UAT**: Production-like settings with staging environment variables
- **Production**: Optimized resource limits, monitoring, and production database connections

### Development Environment Specific Features
- Volume mounts for source code and certificates for local development.
- Hot reload capabilities for development workflow.
- Debug-friendly configurations and logging levels.
- Source code mounting for real-time development.

### Validation
- Environment-specific files provide isolated configurations for each deployment stage.
- All environments use consistent service definitions with environment-appropriate settings.
- API_BASE_URL is correctly set for internal service communication in each environment.
- Network configurations are isolated per environment (xy-dev-network, xy-uat-network, xy-prod-network).

### Testing
You can test different environments with:
```sh
# Development environment
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment dev -Profile http
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment dev -Profile https

# UAT environment  
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment uat -Profile http
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment uat -Profile https

# Production environment
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment prod -Profile https -CleanCache
```
- For HTTP, open: http://localhost:5002
- For HTTPS, open: https://localhost:5003

**Conclusion:**
Environment-specific Docker Compose files provide better isolation, configuration management, and deployment flexibility. Each environment has its own optimized settings while maintaining consistency in service definitions.

## Section 2: Environment-Specific Docker Compose Architecture

The current setup uses dedicated files for each environment instead of a base + override approach:

- **docker-compose.dev.yml**:  
  Complete configuration for development environment with hot reload, source mounting, and debugging features enabled.

- **docker-compose.uat.yml**:  
  Complete configuration for UAT/staging environment with production-like settings for integration testing.

- **docker-compose.prod.yml**:  
  Complete configuration for production environment with optimized resource limits, monitoring, and production database connections.

**How they work:**  
- Each environment file is completely self-contained with all necessary service definitions.
- The PowerShell script (start-docker.ps1) automatically selects the appropriate file based on the -Environment parameter.
- Sharedsettings files provide environment-specific configuration that gets injected at runtime.

**Example Usage:**  
- Development: `.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment dev -Profile http`
- UAT Testing: `.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment uat -Profile https`
- Production: `.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment prod -Profile https -CleanCache`

**Summary:**  
- Each environment has a dedicated, complete Docker Compose configuration.
- No file merging or override complexity - each file stands alone.
- Environment-specific networks and settings provide better isolation.
- PowerShell automation handles environment switching and configuration injection.

## Section 3: Hot Reload Development Setup

For development environments, hot reload is configured for both API and UI projects:

### Development Volume Mounts
- Source code is mounted directly into containers for real-time development.
- Certificate files are mounted for HTTPS development testing.
- Configuration files are mounted for environment-specific settings.

### File Watcher Configuration
- `DOTNET_USE_POLLING_FILE_WATCHER=1` is set in development environment for Windows compatibility.
- File changes are detected and automatically trigger application reloads.
- This ensures seamless development experience with immediate feedback.

### Development Workflow
```sh
# Start development environment with hot reload
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment dev -Profile http

# Make code changes - they will automatically reload
# View changes at: http://localhost:5002
```

### Volume Mount Benefits
- Immediate reflection of code changes without container rebuilds.
- Faster development iteration cycles.
- Full debugging capabilities with source code access.
- Real-time configuration updates.

## Section 4: Configuration Management

### ShareSettings Architecture
The application uses a hierarchical configuration approach:

1. **Base Configuration**: appsettings.json (application defaults)
2. **Environment Settings**: sharedsettings.{env}.json (shared across projects)  
3. **Project Settings**: appsettings.{Environment}.json (project-specific overrides)

### Environment Configuration Files
- `sharedsettings.dev.json` - Development environment settings
- `sharedsettings.uat.json` - UAT/staging environment settings  
- `sharedsettings.prod.json` - Production environment settings

### Configuration Loading Order
```
appsettings.json → sharedsettings.{env}.json → appsettings.{Environment}.json
```

### Key Configuration Areas
- **API Settings**: URLs, ports, HTTPS configuration
- **Database**: Connection strings and settings per environment
- **Docker**: Network names, volume configurations
- **Azure**: Cloud resource configurations for production
- **Logging**: Environment-appropriate logging levels

### Usage in Docker
The PowerShell script automatically:
1. Reads the appropriate sharedsettings file
2. Extracts port configurations
3. Creates environment variables for Docker Compose
4. Ensures network configurations match across all components

This approach ensures consistent configuration management across all deployment scenarios while maintaining environment-specific customizations.
