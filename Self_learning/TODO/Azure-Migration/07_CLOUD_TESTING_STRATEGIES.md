- [ ] ‚úÖ Database `OrderProcessingSystem_Local` created in local SQL Server
- [ ] ‚úÖ Console shows: "Database initialized and AppMasterData loaded successfully during startup"
- [ ] ‚úÖ Local environment script executes: `set-local-env.ps1` configures ports 5010-5013

### Verification Commands:
```powershell
# Check database creation (Note: Uses OrderProcessingSystem_Local for non-Docker)
sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P Admin100@ -Q "SELECT name FROM sys.databases WHERE name = 'OrderProcessingSystem_Local'"

# Test API endpoint
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5010/api/Customer/GetAllCustomers?pageNumber=1&pageSize=3" -Method Get
```

### Test Results:
- [ ] ‚úÖ PASS - All expected results achieved
- [ ] ‚ùå FAIL - Issues found: ________________

## üß™ Test 2: API HTTPS Profile (Non-Docker)

**Profile**: `https` (API project)  
**Target**: https://localhost:5011/swagger

### Steps:
1. [ ] Stop current debugging session (red stop button)
2. [ ] Select "https" profile in dropdown (NOT docker-dev-https)
3. [ ] Press F5 to start debugging
4. [ ] Accept SSL certificate if prompted
5. [ ] Wait for browser to open automatically

### Expected Results:
- [ ] ‚úÖ Application starts without errors

- [ ] ‚úÖ Swagger UI loads with SSL certificate working
- [ ] ‚úÖ Same database `OrderProcessingSystem` used (shared with HTTP)
- [ ] ‚úÖ SSL/TLS encryption working properly

### Verification Commands:
```powershell
# Test HTTPS API endpoint
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://localhost:5011/api/Customer/GetAllCustomers?pageNumber=1&pageSize=3" -Method Get
```

### Test Results:
- [ ] ‚úÖ PASS - All expected results achieved
- [ ] ‚ùå FAIL - Issues found: ________________

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Port Already in Use**: 
   - Check if Docker containers are running: `docker ps`
   - Stop any conflicting services
   
2. **SSL Certificate Issues**:
   - Run: `dotnet dev-certs https --clean`
   - Run: `dotnet dev-certs https --trust`
   
3. **Database Connection Issues**:
   - Verify SQL Server running: `Test-NetConnection localhost -Port 1433`
   - Check connection string in sharedsettings.dev.json

4. **API Connection Issues**:
   - Ensure API is running before starting UI
   - Check CORS settings in API configuration
   - Verify ports not conflicting with Docker
