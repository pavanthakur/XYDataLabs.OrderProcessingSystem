UAT:          Conservative cleanup (preserves recent work)
Production:   Minimal cleanup (production-safe only)
```

### Data Protection
```powershell
# Automatic backups for UAT/Production
# Persistent volume protection
# Configuration backup and restore
```

### Enterprise Logging
```powershell
# Structured audit trail
logs/docker-startup-2025-08-03.log
[2025-08-03 14:30:22] [SUCCESS] Enterprise Docker Management started
```

## üöÄ Immediate Benefits

### For Development
- **Faster Iteration**: Aggressive cleanup removes build artifacts

- **Mandatory Backups**: Enforced backup before any operations
- **Network Security**: Isolated production network
- **Compliance Ready**: Full audit logging for enterprise requirements

## üìã Usage Examples

### Standard Mode (Unchanged)
```powershell
# Your existing commands work exactly as before
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment dev -Profile https
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment uat -Profile all
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment prod -Profile https -Down
```

### Enterprise Mode (New)
```powershell
# Development with enterprise features
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment dev -Profile https -EnterpriseMode

# UAT with conservative cleanup
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment uat -Profile all -EnterpriseMode -ConservativeClean

# Production with mandatory backup
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment prod -Profile all -EnterpriseMode -BackupFirst

# Safe cleanup preserving persistent data
.\start-docker.ps1 -Environment any -Profile any -EnterpriseMode -PreservePersistentData
```
